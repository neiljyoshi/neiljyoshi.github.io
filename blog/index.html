        <h1>Hey there, welcome to my blog!</h1>
        <p>Just a place where I share what I'm learning about DevOps, tech, and a bit of everything else.</p>
        <p>Here you'll find posts mainly related to computer science, DevOps and experiences that I encounter in my daily life as an DevOps engineer. 
        Some blogs are deep dives into concepts, while others are DIY projects, experiments, or quick notes — basically the stuff I'm figuring out along the way.</p>

        <p>This is like my personal notebook made public — if you’re into tech, DevOps, you might find something useful here.</p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by — hope you find something cool!</p>
